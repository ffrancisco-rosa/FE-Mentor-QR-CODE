### What I learned

This project was done to complete the first challenge on the frontendmentor.io platform.
Was good to recap how to center both vertically and horizontally a absolute positined element, since it is not a common occurence on the average web app development.

Mentioned css snippet: 
```css
.qr-code-wrapper{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
}
```
